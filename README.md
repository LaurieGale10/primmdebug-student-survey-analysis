# PRIMMDebug Initial Research Study: Analysis of Student Survey
This repository contains the vode used to analyse the student survey responses from students who had used PRIMMDebug in their computing lessons.

The analysis is currently <ins>work-in-progress</ins>, but for now you can find an intuitive look at each step of the analysis in `analysis.ipynb`. The data has not been added to the repository yet as it has not been properly anonymised.

Analysis of the survey responses is expected to be finished by June 2025.
